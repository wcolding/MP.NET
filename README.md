# Mario Party .NET
#### An incomplete simulation of a Mario Party game
### 
Here is a little project I worked on a while back to learn and better understand class structure in C#. 

I chose to replicate the mechanics of Mario Party games (you know, the *real* ones) as they offered a specific set of problems to solve and a highly-structured ruleset. The code is largely inefficient in a number of places, but writing it was instructive. Maybe it'll be useful for somebody looking to understand how C# classes interact. 

The simulation randomly generates a board and characters, and provides a seed for reproducing the results.

I have no real plans to expand on this project, although the groundwork is somewhat laid if anybody wanted to throw some of this code into Unity. Just make sure to call it Murphy O's Party or something.
